**coinmarketcap** is an APACHE licensed library written in Python designed to provide a simple to use API for [coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/). As coinmarketcap does not provide any API endpoints, this code is pretty dirty.

## Installation:

From source use

    $ python setup.py install

or install from PyPi

    $ pip install coinmarketcap
